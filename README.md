#### Installation

If you want to build your own version, make sure you have gnuclad
installed.

To install gnuclad, you can download it at https://launchpad.net/gnuclad

For Arch users, use the AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gnuclad/

After you have installed gnuclad, to build just the svg, run:

    gnuclad gldt.csv SVG gldt.conf

You can run the script `build.sh` to build the svg, png, and the tarball
containing the source.
